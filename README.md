This branch takes the app to the web. This means a client-server architecture.

We used Spring boot and JPA in this project.

Thus you just need to clone and run, like this:

```
git clone -b App06 https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/software-architecture-2018-2.git

cd software-architecture-2018-2
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
